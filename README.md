# PolyPrioritize
A small utility mod for use with [PolyMc](https://github.com/TheEpicBlock/PolyMc).  
It reads from the config and prioritizes all of the blocks in it. This means they'll get a poly first.  
If you have issues with blocks turning into stone due to block limits running out, this mod will help you prioritize important blocks first.

For more customisation, check out the [PolyMc api](https://theepicblock.github.io/PolyMc/api/).
